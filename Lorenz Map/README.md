# The Lorenz Map is a powerful tool for analyzing the behavior of oscillations, particularly to determine if they exhibit chaotic behavior. 
# Its objective is to obtain the maximum values over time and create a scatter plot of Max versus Max+n. 
# If the resulting graph shows a single or two well-defined points, or a set of three points, the conclusion is that the oscillation is regular.

# On the other hand, if the points are distributed in a trajectory, forming a pattern, it is indicative that the oscillation may exhibit chaos.
